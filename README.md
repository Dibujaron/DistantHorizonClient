Distant Horizon was a project creating a web game about realistic space travel. You played as a merchant spaceship captain flying between space stations in a large solar system, using flip-and-burn type trajectories to navigate between the orbiting planets. It was a really cool and featured very challenging physics problems to solve, but ultimately I spent a month on the AI pathfinder and could not find a way to make it scale well enough to have this game be feasible in production. It's now open source and is available for free use.
